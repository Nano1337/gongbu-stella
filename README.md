## **Interview Script: Explaining GongBu's System Design**

---

**Introduction:**

"Thank you for the opportunity to discuss my project, **GongBu**, a SwiftUI-based iOS application designed to help users learn Korean through interactive writing and speaking exercises. I'd like to walk you through the system design, highlighting the key components, functionalities, and the rationale behind the architectural decisions I made."

---

**1. **Overall Architecture:**

"GongBu follows the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architectural pattern, which promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase more manageable and scalable. Utilizing **SwiftUI** allows for declarative UI design, facilitating dynamic and responsive interfaces."

---

**2. **Key Components:**

- **Models:**
  - `WordPair`: Represents pairs of Korean and English words.
  - `GameState`: Manages the application's state, including navigation, game configuration, scoring, and timer functionalities.

- **Views:**
  - `DesignView`: The landing screen with animated stars and a start button.
  - `HandwritingView` & `SpeakingView`: Interfaces for writing and speaking exercises, respectively.
  - `LevelSelectionView` & `LevelDetailView`: Allow users to select difficulty levels and manage question counts.
  - `ContentView`: Acts as the central navigation hub, switching between different views based on user interactions.

- **ViewModels:**
  - `SpeakingViewModel`: Handles the logic for recording and transcribing speech using Firebase Vertex AI.

- **Utilities & Services:**
  - `FirebaseVertexAI`: Integrated for handwriting and speech recognition.
  - `CSVParser`: Parses CSV files containing word pairs.
  - `AudioRecorder`: Manages audio recording functionalities.
  - `GoogleCloudAPI`: Interfaces with Firebase Vertex AI for processing handwriting and speech inputs.

---

**3. **Functional Workflow:**

- **User Onboarding:**
  - Users start at the `DesignView`, where they're greeted with an animated interface.
  - Upon tapping "Start Learning," users navigate to `LevelSelectionView` to choose their desired difficulty level.

- **Learning Modules:**
  - Depending on the selected level, the app loads relevant word pairs from CSV files using `CSVParser`.
  - In `LevelDetailView`, users can choose between writing (`HandwritingView`) or speaking (`SpeakingView`) exercises.
  
- **Handwriting Module:**
  - `CanvasView` allows users to draw the Korean word.
  - Upon submission, the drawing is sent to Firebase Vertex AI via `GoogleCloudAPI` for recognition.
  - The recognized text is compared with the correct answer to provide feedback.

- **Speaking Module:**
  - Users record their pronunciation in `SpeakingView`.
  - The audio is transcribed using Firebase Vertex AI through `SpeakingViewModel`.
  - Similar to handwriting, feedback is provided based on accuracy.

- **Game Management:**
  - `GameState` oversees the flow of questions, tracking scores, and managing the timer.
  - Users can select the number of questions, with options for repetitions or unlimited practice.

---

**4. **Design Decisions & Justifications:**

- **SwiftUI & MVVM:**
  - Choosing SwiftUI for its modern declarative syntax enables swift UI development and real-time previews.
  - MVVM facilitates a clear separation between UI and business logic, enhancing testability and maintainability.

- **Firebase Vertex AI Integration:**
  - Leveraging Firebase Vertex AI provides robust machine learning capabilities for handwriting and speech recognition without managing backend infrastructure.
  - Asynchronous operations ensure a smooth user experience without blocking the main thread.

- **Dynamic UI Elements:**
  - Implementing animations, such as shimmering stars in `DesignView`, enhances user engagement.
  - Responsive layouts adjust seamlessly across different device sizes.

- **State Management with `GameState`:**
  - Centralizing state management simplifies the synchronization of data across various views.
  - Using `@Published` properties ensures that UI components automatically reflect state changes.

- **CSV Parsing for Content Management:**
  - Storing word pairs in CSV files allows for easy scalability and content updates without altering the codebase.
  - `CSVParser` ensures efficient parsing and error handling during data loading.

- **User Feedback Mechanisms:**
  - Providing immediate feedback on users' inputs promotes effective learning and retention.
  - Utilizing visual cues like color changes and text messages reinforces correct or incorrect responses.

---

**5. **Error Handling & User Experience:**

- **Alert Systems:**
  - Implementing alerts ensures users are informed of any errors, such as failed recordings or recognition issues, enhancing transparency and trust.

- **Loading Indicators:**
  - Progress views during asynchronous operations, like transcription, keep users informed about the application's state, preventing confusion.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Ensuring that the app remains responsive during heavy operations like API calls maintains a high-quality user experience.

---

**6. **Security & API Key Management:**

- **API Keys:**
  - Storing API keys in `GenerativeAI-Info.plist` and accessing them securely through `APIKey` enum ensures that sensitive information is not hard-coded, adhering to best security practices.

---

**Conclusion:**

"In summary, **GongBu** is architected to provide an engaging and efficient learning experience for users through well-structured components, seamless integrations with Firebase Vertex AI, and thoughtful UI/UX designs. The choices made in adopting SwiftUI, MVVM, and leveraging cloud-based AI services were driven by the goals of scalability, maintainability, and delivering a responsive user experience."
